# QuestionTime-site
This is the ReactJS site for my QuestionTime application, I have put together this site so that I can talk about it during technical interviews and it also shows my reactjs and typescript skills. 

This site is not the most eye pleasing at the moment but I will spruce it up with Material-UI when I get the chance.
